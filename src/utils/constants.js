      "Botanica ArteLab is an environmentally friendly botanic and textile art company that was created in 2017. This project was born from a strong desire and impulse to eternalize the ephemeral beauty of nature and register the beauty of life and its cycles in different ways. We want to preserve the nature that surrounds us, alive and beautiful as it is. Therefore, the need to create products that offer ecological and sustainable solutions for our daily lives and for the planet emerged.",

      " We work with nature through manual pressing and natural dyes using traditional techniques. In an attempt to increase the useful life of a material, we also resort to the recycling of textiles and other materials/waste, transforming them into a new product.",
